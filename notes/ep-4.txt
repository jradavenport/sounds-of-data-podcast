Episode: An audio tour of a telescope

What does APO sound like? A place I've spent a long time at.

Sounds to collect:
- sounds in airport, airplanes, etc. This is how observing often starts
- Sound of Dome Opening (beeps and motors)
- sound of mirror covers opening
- sounds of cooling systems, hissing of N2 valves, cryotigers
- Sounds of Telescope moving (quiet)
- Sound of outside at night
- Sound of thunderstorm if possible
- Sound of TUI, maybe a chat w/ R.Owens about why the sounds

give audio tour, have photos online for all the sounds too if possible
