Episode: Data Sonification: Analysis


A joke in astronomy about Jodie Foster sitting around the VLA with headphones. Often imitated. But raises a useful Q: how could you be a blind radio astronomer working for SETI?


What can your ear measure: can locate (rough but useful), hear volume (coarse), and tone/pitch. This is the same number of properties your eye can instantaneously measure: location, intensity, color/freq. Eyes can also detect motion

Q: what is frequency resolution of ears?

Q: eyes can see and process large volume of things at once, how much can ears understand at once?


Some say data visualization cannot be made full for the ears
