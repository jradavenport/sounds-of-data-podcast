	what are we going to do with data visualization for the blind? 
	This is a very interesting question!

	- On the one hand we have [Data Sonification], where we match data to audio
		- many examples from Alex Parker
		- example from Earthquake viz/audio after Japan

	- some people say data viz cannot be made accessible fully (e.g. Stephen Few)

	- On the other hand, we could discuss or express data results 
		big history of this from radio journalism

- how to enable scientific exploration for the blind?

- there is a similarity in my mind between the attempts at high order data visualization and visualization to the blind.

- a big problem in outreach access here. how to communicate scientific results with the blind? Especially senses of scale in astronomy!


What is this podcast series about? What are the goals?
- started as learning about data analysis w/o vision
- morphing in to also an audio tour of being a scientist
- share sounds, info, data. readers of my blog will probably
