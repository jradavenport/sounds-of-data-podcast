Episode: An audio tour of an astronomy meeting

What does it sound like to be at a major astronomy conference? Can be an overwhelming array of people mostly

Sounds to collect:
- sounds in airport, airplanes, etc. This is how meetings start
- sounds of beach, since this one is in Hawaii
- Sound of conference hall, lots of voices
- sounds of talks, convos in the hallway, the business of science getting done
- sounds of keyboards clicking in talks, something i find annoying but needed
- sounds of twitter going "tweet". talk abut meetings being online too
- chat with a few friends about their research. some in hallway, some in poster hall, some in cafe or bar.
- sounds of protesters/protectors of the mountain. give a minute at least to this topic, maybe chat with somebody on the street about it


Talks are possibly accessible (except SO much is given visually) but posters would be very hard to browse. Yet a TON of science is conveyed at these meetings in posters
+ good: can have convos with people in poster sessions
- bad: can't just browse if can't see
- abstracts online, which help (tho system isnt very easy to browse, even w/ vision). maybe useful to put posters online for OCR programs to help.
