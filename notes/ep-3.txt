Episode: An audio tour of a telescope

What does APO sound like? Someplace I've spent a long time at.

Sounds to collect:
- Sound of Dome Opening (beeps and motors)
- Sounds of Telescope moving (quiet)
- Sound of outside at night
- Sound of thunderstorm if possible
- Sound of TUI, maybe a chat w/ R.Owens about why the sounds
